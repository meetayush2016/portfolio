        A front-end developer is a skilled professional who is responsible for designing and developing the user-facing side of websites, web applications, and other digital products. This includes everything that a user sees and interacts with, such as the layout, design, and functionality of a website.

As a front-end developer, the individual needs to have a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as various front-end frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue. They are also expected to have a good eye for design and be able to work closely with designers to ensure that the visual elements of a website are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.
